Vim as an IDE provides an out of the box IDE like experience using existing vim plugins.

It is intended to allow vim users to get up and running quickly with a minimal set of plugins and configuration options.

- Buffer browsing using MiniBufExplorer (6.5.2)
- Function/Class outline viewer using Tagbar (2.6.1)
- Buffer management using bufkill
- SuperTab! (2.0)
- delimitMate (2.6)
- A customised .vimrc file which integrates these plugins and other vim features to provide a basic integrated development environment.
